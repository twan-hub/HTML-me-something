   I enjoy participating in sports ranging from lacrosse and
   wrestling to ultimate frisbee and curlling.
   I have volunteered alot over the years giving back to the community and 
   pouring back into youth. I do this by participating in summer camps, and traveling around the world spreading the word
   of God.

   Growing up was interesting. My youngest brother as diagnosed
   with Autism at a young age. Even though this was new to everyone my parents took it in stride. Thanks to my brother life
   has always been interesting in a good way. Everyday was like an adventure and spontaneous. From different types of theraputic
   treatments we attended or just walking in the park.
